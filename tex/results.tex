\subsection{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
	\item as expected, foraging trips take longer over steeper incline and decline
	\begin{itemize}
		\item also taking longer over uphill versus downhill inclines
	\end{itemize}
	\vspace{1em}

	\item the foraging path is generally more stable with steep incline or decline
	\begin{itemize}
		%\item path is smoother
		\item ants are less likely to get lost/stuck
		\item this effect is less pronounced in the center-to-center arena
	\end{itemize}
	\vspace{1em}

	\item the foraging path becomes more direct with steeper incline or decline
	\vspace{-1em}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item even though the direct path is not aligned with the incline in the corner-to-corner arena
		\item this effect is less pronounced in the center-to-center arena
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
